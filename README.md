## Project: E-commerce Data Pipeline and Analytics Dashboard

This project will involve creating a data pipeline to collect, process, and analyze e-commerce data, then visualizing the results in a dashboard. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Data Collection:
- Simulate an e-commerce dataset or use a public dataset (e.g., from Kaggle)
- Set up a data ingestion process (e.g., using Apache Kafka or AWS Kinesis)

2. Data Storage:
- Design a data warehouse schema (e.g., using PostgreSQL or Amazon Redshift)
- Implement data storage solution


3. Data Processing:
- Create ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) jobs using tools like Apache Spark or Python scripts
- Implement data cleaning and transformation processes


4. Data Analysis:
- Perform exploratory data analysis using SQL or Python libraries (pandas, numpy)
- Calculate key metrics (e.g., daily active users, conversion rates, average order value)

5. Data Visualization:
- Create an interactive dashboard using tools like Tableau, Power BI, or a web framework (e.g., Dash, Streamlit)
- Display key metrics, trends, and insights

6. Automation and Scheduling:
- Set up automated data refresh and pipeline execution (e.g., using Apache Airflow)

7. Documentation and Testing:
- Write clear documentation for your project
- Implement unit tests for your data processing functions

8. Version Control and CI/CD:
- Use Git for version control
- Set up a basic CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions)
